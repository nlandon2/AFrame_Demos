# AFrame Demos

These are the source codes for the demos that I used to introduce A-Frame.
Demo 1 is the one I used to introduce myself, Demo 2 is the one showing Earth and Mars, and Demo 3 is the one showing day and night.

## Getting Started with A-Frame

1. Make an HTML document with `<head>` and `<body>`
2. In `<head>`, add 
  `<script src=”https://aframe.io/releases/0.9.0/aframe.min.js” ></script>`
   to import a-frame
3. In `<body>`, create `<a-scene>`
4. If you want images, add `<a-assets>`
5. Add Primitives within `<a-scene>`: `<a-box>`, `<a-sky>`, etc.
6. Run a local server using command like `python –m SimpleHTTPServer` for testing
